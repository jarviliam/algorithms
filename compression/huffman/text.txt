Oh, there is a house
A wonderful lover
A satisfied home
Hope isn't a word
A sudden sad brother
And what do you care?
And I'll take the pictures
If you stay in bed
I'll run down the park
If you put up your head

Don't put up your borderline
Don't put up your borderline

Oh, there is a house
A wonderful lover
And what do you care?
Four or five years ago
I wouldn't believe it
I wouldn't receive it
And I'll take the stiches
You put in my head
I'll run down the ark
If you put up your head

Don't put up your borderline
Don't put up your borderline

Borderline
Borderline

It feels like I'm going to lose my mind
It feels like I'm going to lose my mind
